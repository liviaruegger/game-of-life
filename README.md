# Conway's Game of Life

 This is a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) scripted in Lua, using the [LÃ–VE 2D](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

#### Controls
- Left click to set a cell to alive
- Right click to set a cell to dead
- Press any key to step foward in time

*Notes: this is a work in progress. So far, I have mostly followed [this](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/life/) tutorial (which I highly recommend), but I'm planning on adding features like the optional use of pre-defined shapes to draw and a simple main menu.*
