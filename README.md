# Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) scripted in Lua, using the [LÃ–VE 2D](https://love2d.org/) game engine. You can play it on your browser [here](https://liviaruegger.itch.io/game-of-life).

I took on this project for learning purposes, so don't expect any surprises: just a simple menu and the game itself. I followed tutorials, consulted forums and used tools programmed by other people; these are all credited bellow. 

- For the game, I mostly followed [this](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/life/) tutorial.
- For the menu, [this](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=86394) thread was very helpful.
- To port the game for web, I used [this](https://github.com/Davidobot/love.js) package.
