# Conway's Game of Life

 A simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) scripted in Lua, using the [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/) game engine.

#### How to play
- If you have LÖVE installed system-wide, you can start the game by simply double clicking the <code>.love</code> file (or if you have the stand-alone version, just drag the <code>.love</code> file onto <code>love.exe</code> or a shortcut to <code>love.exe</code>).
- If you do not have LÖVE, you can either download it [here](https://love2d.org/) or just run the game directly from the executable inside the <code>executable.zip</code> folder. Note that you have to keep the <code>.dll</code> files for it to work.

#### Controls
- Left click to set a cell to alive
- Right click to set a cell to dead
- Press any key to step foward in time

*Notes: this is a work in progress. So far, I have mostly followed [this](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/life/) tutorial (which I highly recommend), but I'm planning on adding features like the optional use of pre-defined shapes to draw and a simple main menu. Also, I might as well add implementations of the Game of Life in other languages to this repository.*
